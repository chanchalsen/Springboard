1. Predicting the credibility of a person of getting a loan 

Comments: Too broad and common


2. How long can a loan last (basically predicting the time until a loan is paid off)

Comments: common problem and sample data set available in kaggle


3. Predicting the returning customer ( predict the current customer can be a potential returning customer and his chances of getting the next loan)

Comments: Sound good but requires sample data points.
