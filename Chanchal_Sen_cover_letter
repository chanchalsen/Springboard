Dear Hiring Manager,

I would like to introduce myself as an applicant for the Data Scientist position at Google, a prestigious and reputable name in innovative technology. I am confident in my ability to perform as a Data Scientist at Google due to my extensive education and work experience.

It was a mix of Data engineering and Data scientist activities that I was indulged in and was responsible for delivering the end product to the customer. As a Data Scientist, I was required to have excellent communication skills, understanding of algorithms, proficiency in SQL along with data pipelines, and statistics. During my eight-year career, I applied the skills and performed exceptionally in all the companies.

I began with a bachelor's degree in Information and Technology from Orrisa Engineering College and continued in the industry with a mix of roles and challenges. I believe my personality has also played a major role in my ability to succeed in my career. In a nutshell, I am an extremely analytical, data-oriented, and calculated person.
